# **MicroHack Overview**

MicroHacks are great for building base knowledge for people new to a technical area. However, they are often too high-level to build technical readiness in many niche areas of Azure that our customers need support on.  Our teams often hear from customers once they have read documentation and tried to setup a PoC. If this fails, they come to us looking for support. To be effective in this situation we need to build additional ‘hands on’ technical readiness.

## **What is a MicroHack?** 
A MicroHack is a small workshop, less than four hours, where you’ll get hands-on experience and solve different challenges to better understand a certain technology / topic. Let’s say, it’s the mini Version of an OpenHack which focuses on real life scenario or transformation.

## **How does it work?**
There are many small individual MicroHacks that build on each other and therefore have certain dependencies. In each MicroHack the requirements are therefore described to understand exactly what must be done before. The procedure is described relatively simple and explained step by step what to do. You have to fulfill certain challenge based tasks before you can continue with the next challenge. At first glance, everything looks simple, but if you take a closer look, the whole construct is revealed at the end of the MicroHack series. 

## **What is the benefit?**
The great benefit of MicroHacks is that you can quickly, precisely and hands on understand one or the combination of several services. There are often only a few concrete tasks to do and the hands on experience is lifted to the next level in a very short time. After completing all the challenges you will almost certainly have jumped over your own shadow, expanded the mindset and can directly deal with the implementation in practice and outside of a lab environment. 

## Why? 
Why a MicroHack is necessary

# Pre-requisites

### License
Regarding licenses, just read the requirements in each MicroHack. It describes exactly which requirements are necessary to perform the MicroHack alone or together with Microsoft colleagues. If you are supported by a partner or directly by Microsoft, you can always contact a colleague at the partner or your Microsoft account team. 

### Tenant
A tenant is always required as the basis for each MicroHack. We explain this in the Foundation and show you how to create a tenant if you don't have one yet. 

### Subscription
Some microhack also requires an Azure subscription. This always depends on the topic, but as mentioned above, before each MicroHack we will show you exactly which requirements you need.
