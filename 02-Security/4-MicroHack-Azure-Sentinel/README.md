# Scenario

Describe the scenario here...

## Context

This MicroHack scenario walks through the use of Azure Sentinel with a focus on the best practices and the design principles. Specifically, this builds up to include working with an existing infrastructure.

This lab is not a full explanation of Azure Sentinel as a technology, please consider the following articles required pre-reading to build foundational knowledge.

- [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/overview] - What is Azure Sentinel? 
- [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sentinel/#features] - Build next-generation security operations with cloud and AI.

Optional (read this after completing this lab to take your learning even deeper!

- [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/quickstart-onboard] - Quickstart: On-board Azure Sentinel
- [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-sentinel/] - Learn: Introduction to Azure Sentinel

# Pre-requisites

## Overview

In order to use the MicroHack time most effectively, the following tasks should be completed prior to starting the session.

With these pre-requisites in place, we can focus on building the differentiated knowledge in Azure Sentinel that is required when working with the product, rather than spending hours repeating relatively simple tasks such as setting up Log Analytics 

At the end of this section your base lab build looks as follows:

![image](Path to the architecture )

In summary:

- Azure Subscription 
- Resource Group 
- Log Analytics Workspace 
- Azure Sentinel 

Permissions for the deployment: 
- Contributor on your Resource Group

## Task 1 : Deploy Template

We are going to use a predefined ARM template to deploy the base environment. It will be deployed in to *your* Azure subscription, with resources running in the your specified Azure region.

To start the ARM deployment, follow the steps listed below:

- Login to Azure cloud shell [https://shell.azure.com/](https://shell.azure.com/)
- Ensure that you are operating within the correct subscription via:

`az account show`

- Clone the following GitHub repository 

`git clone Link to Github Repo `


## Task 2 : Explore and verify the deployed resources



## Task 3 : Name..



Now that we have the base lab deployed, we can progress to the Azure Sentinel challenges!
