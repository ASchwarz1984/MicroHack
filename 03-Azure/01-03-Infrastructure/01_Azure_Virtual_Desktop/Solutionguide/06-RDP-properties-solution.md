# Exercise 6: Customize RDP Properties

Duration:


[Previous Challenge](./05-scaling-plan-solution.md) - **[Home](../readme.md)** - **[Next Challenge](06-RDP-properties-solution.md)**

In this challenge, you will configure optimal user experience by customizing RDP Properties.

Azure Virtual Desktop enables you to configure and customize Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) properties for a host pool. Customizing a host pool's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) properties, such as multi-monitor experience and audio redirection, lets you deliver an optimal experience for your users based on their needs. If you'd like to change the default RDP file properties, you can customize RDP properties in Azure Virtual Desktop by either using the Azure portal or by using the -CustomRdpProperty parameter in the Update-AzWvdHostPool cmdlet.

## Add or edit multiple custom RDP properties with Powershell
To add or edit multiple custom RDP properties, run the following PowerShell cmdlets by providing the custom RDP properties as a semicolon-separated string:
PowerShell

``
$properties="audiocapturemode:i:1; camerastoredirect:s:*; drivestoredirect:s:; redirectclipboard:i:1;redirectprinters:i:0"
``

``
Update-AzWvdHostPool -ResourceGroupName <resourcegroupname> -Name <hostpoolname> -CustomRdpProperty $properties
``

You can check to make sure the RDP property was added by running the following cmdlet:

``
Get-AzWvdHostPool -ResourceGroupName <resourcegroupname> -Name <hostpoolname> | format-list Name, CustomRdpProperty
``

## Task2:
Remote App Pool
- Allow Multiple Displays
- Smart Sizing should be enabled
- Deny Camera, Microphone and Copy&Paste.
- Allow Storage and networkdrive and printer redirection.

 In your Remote App Hostpool, navigate to RDP Properties

## Configure the following settings:

### Session behaviour
- Multiple displays: Enable multiple display support
- Smart sizing: The local window content will scale when resized

- camera redirection: Don't redirect any cameras
- Drive/storage redirection: Redirect all drives, including ones that are connected later 
- Clipboard redirection: Clipboard on local computer isn't available in the remote session
- Printer Redirection: The printers on the local computer are available in the remote session

## Add or edit multiple custom RDP properties with Powershell
To add or edit multiple custom RDP properties, run the following PowerShell cmdlets by providing the custom RDP properties as a semicolon-separated string:
PowerShell
``$properties="audiocapturemode:i:0; camerastoredirect:s:0; drivestoredirect:s:; redirectclipboard:i:1;redirectprinters:i:1"``

``Update-AzWvdHostPool -ResourceGroupName <resourcegroupname> -Name <hostpoolname> -CustomRdpProperty $properties``
You can check to make sure the RDP property was added by running the following cmdlet:
``Get-AzWvdHostPool -ResourceGroupName <resourcegroupname> -Name <hostpoolname> | format-list Name, CustomRdpProperty``
