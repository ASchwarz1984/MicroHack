Duration: 30 minutes

[Previous Challenge Solution](../challenge-1/solution.md) - **[Home](../../Readme.md)** - [Next Challenge Solution](../challenge-3/solution.md)

## Prerequisites

Please ensure that you successfully passed [challenge 1](../../Readme.md#challenge-1) before continuing with this challenge.

In this challenge you will successfully onboard your Windows and Linux Virtual Machines to a centralized Recovery Services Vault and leverage Azure Backup Center to Protect with Backup in Azure. 

### Actions

* Deploy a Windows Server 2022 VM in Germany West Central Resource Group. Please use the "Data Science Virtual Machine - Windows 2022" image from the market place.
> **Note:** The 'Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM)' is a 'Windows Server 2022 with Containers' VM that has several popular tools for data exploration, analysis, modeling & development pre installed.
> You will to use Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to connect to the database and Storage Explorer to the storage Account.
* Deploy a Ubuntu Server VM in Sweden Central Resource Group
* Deploy a azure sql database server with a database containing the sample data of AdventureWorksLT.
* From the Data Science Windows Server VM, connect to the database  and to the storage account.
* Create a blob container and upload a sample file to it
* Enable Azure Backup for both VMs
* Enable Azure Backup for blobs on the storage account.
* Restore a VM in Azure
* Delete and restore the sample blob file


### Task 1: Create a new Virtual Machine in Azure Region Germany West Central

As a first step, we will create a VM (Name: ds-vm-win-serverl) in Azure in the resource group "mh-bcdr-gwc-rg" that we created in the last challenge. This should be a Data Science Virtual Machine - Windows 2022 using a VM Type of Standard DS3v2.
