### **Task 2: Install the Azure Migrate Appliance software**

To start physical server discovery you must install the Azure Migrate Appliance on your on-premises. The Azure Migrate Appliance can be downloaded as a OVA or VHD template or you can download a ZIP file containing a PowerShell script to install it on an already existing server. For the purpose of this MicroHack we will install the Azure Migrate Appliance via the PowerShell script on the already deployed Server **MHBOX-AzMigSrv**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please make sure to check the [prerequisites](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/tutorial-discover-physical#prerequisites) of the Azure Migrate Appliance.

In the Azure Portal select *Virtual machines* from the navigation pane on the left. Select the *MHBox-HV* system and logon via Azure Bastion with you credentials:

> [!NOTE]
> You can also select *Password from Azure KeyVault* under *Authentication Type* to sekect the secret stored in the KeyVault.

Start the Hyper-V Manager and connect to the **MHBOX-AzMigSrv** server.

The following credentials are beeing used inside the nested VMs

**Windows virtual machine credentials:**

```text
Username: Administrator
Password: JS123!!
```

**Ubuntu virtual machine credentials:**

```text
Username: jumpstart
Password: JS123!!
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please make sure to run the following commands inside of the **MHBOX-AzMigSrv** virtual machine that was created for the mirgration appliance during the deployment.

After successfull authentication, the appliance will be registered with the Azure Migrate project.

![image](./img/Discover14.png)

Next you need to specify the credentials that will be used to connect to the hypervisor for discovery of the guest-VMs.

> [!NOTE]
> For the Username and Password check the secrets within the KeyVault.

![image](./img/Discover15.png)

Next you need to map the credential to the hyper-V host. Make sure that validation is successfull.
